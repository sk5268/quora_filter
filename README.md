# Quora Filter
Experimental extention to filter out image-only posts from quora feed.

## Idea
I don't always want to see images on my feed.<br>
Sometimes i'm here just to read some good stories.

## 'Literature' Survey
There are a few extentions which block the images (& videos), but they leave a blank white canvas behind and/or also take out the profile pictures.

I need the entire post removed, not just the image.
